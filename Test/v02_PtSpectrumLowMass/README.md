### Motivation
- One of the investigation of the drop in the efficiency near dilepton mass ~ 2 * leading lepton pT threshold
- below that mass (e.g. 22+10 GeV in muon channel), average pT decreases as dilepton mass increases
   - opposite to the common sense
- hypothesis: just below 32 GeV, even soft jet emission can make the event pass acceptance cut
   - the cross section of soft-jet emission >> hard-jet emission
   - Events with soft-jet emission is dominant among the events passing acceptance cuts
   - Most of the muons in those events have pT values near pT threshold: not very far from the threshold
   - Average pT would be small (even smaller than the lower mass region which require hard-jet emission)
