# Consistency check: paper vs. input for the  covariance matrices (muon channel)

## Comparison: paper vs. input

Exaxctly same values

- Differential cross section
- Statistical uncertainty
- Efficiency SF uncertainty
- Acceptance+PDF uncertainty

Different values between them

* Background uncertainty
* Detector resolution uncertainty
* FSR uncertainty



## Comparison: before smoothing vs. input

Results with different value in previous comparison (bkg, det.Res, FSR) are exactly same with the values from values before smoothing
