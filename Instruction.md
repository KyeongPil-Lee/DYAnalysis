### Rule

* Committed files
  * The code to produce results
  * The ROOT file with results
  * The code to produce the validation plots
* NOT commited files
  * Previous version of the ROOT files (already saved in the history of the git)
  * Validation codes to compare with the previous version or the other people's results
    * It could be comiitted for conivenence, but eventually they should be moved to the archive and not remained in the respository
